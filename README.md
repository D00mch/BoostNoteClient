To run the project [download apk](https://github.com/Liverm0r/BoostNoteClient/blob/master/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk) on your android device and install it (make sure, you permitted unknown sources in the settings).
If you have not, you will probably have to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) and launch an app with emulator.
